## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

By completing this project, I explored several Unity concepts:

- Adding **music** and **sound effects** 🎵  
- Creating **dynamic endless repeating backgrounds** 🌄  
- Spawning and timing **obstacles** ⚠️  
- Using **particle effects** like splatters and explosions 💥  
- Building a satisfying **moment-to-moment gameplay loop**

This project is meant as a practice ground for Unity skills in audio, VFX, and procedural gameplay elements.
